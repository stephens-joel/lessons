About File Explorer {#about-file-explorer}
-------------------

*File Explorer* is the program used to explore the files on your
computer, whether they be files you’ve made, downloaded, or files that
the system uses to do its job. you can use it to move or copy files
around, remove files, rename them, or view their statistics. You can
also open them in any program that supports the type of file.

Note that in older versions of Windows, “File Explorer” is called
“Windows Explorer.”

Beginning exploration {#beginning-exploration}
---------------------

To open File Explorer, press **Windows + E**. You’ll be placed in the
frequent folders list. This is more of a horizontal list, so use
**Right** or **Left** arrows to navigate. Moving down will put you
either farther down the list of folders, or put you into the “recent
files” list.

To open a folder or file, just press **Enter** on it. You can try this
with the “documents” folder in the list. Press **Right Arrow** until you
hear “documents”, then press **Enter**. If this doesn’t work, let your
instructor know. After pressing **Enter** on the “documents” folder,
you’ll be in another list of files. This is a vertical list, and is
navigated with the up and down arrows. There are, however, columns in
this list, making it more like a table. These columns show other
information about the files in the list, like their sizes, dates of
modification, and file type. if you become stuck in one of these
columns, press **Left Arrow** a few times until you hear the *file
name*. The file name is what the file is called, like “lesson6.html”.
“Lesson 6” is the name, while “HTML” which stands for “Hyper Text Markup
Language” is the file type.

File types {#file-types}
----------

In your exploration of files, you may have discovered that files don’t
end with just their name. They have a period, then a 2, 3, or more,
letter suffix. In your documents folder, for example, you may see a file
named document.docx, text.txt, python-program.py, spreadsheet.xlsx,
presentation.pptx, or even program.exe. If you’ve not seen all of them,
you will in your travels. Here is a list of the most common ones, and
what they mean.

DOCX
:   Microsoft Word document

TXT
:   Text document

RTF
:   Rich Text file

XLSX
:   Excel Spreadsheet

Doc
:   Old Microsoft Word file, from Word 97 to 2003

PPTX
:   Powerpoint Presentation file.

HTML
:   web page file

EXE
:   Executable program.

MSI
:   Program Installer file.

MP3
:   MP3 audio file

JPG
:   JPEG image file.

WAV
:   Audio Wave file

MP4
:   Video file.

DMG
:   Disk Image; this usually contains a program made for Mac computers.

Some operating systems, like Mac and Linux, do not need file type
suffixes, because it is in the file itself what it is, so some files you
may download will not always have a suffix.

Tabbing around {#tabbing-around}
--------------

You may use the **Tab** key to move around the Explorer window. This
will not move you to files, just different parts of the window. Most of
them aren’t very useful, except for the tree view.

The tree view allows one to navigate quickly to different folders, or,
more technically, parts of the file system. You can use your arrow keys
to move to a folder, and press **Enter** to go to it. Then, if
necessary, use the **Tab** key to go to the list of files and folders
within that folder.

Menu bars {#menu-bars}
---------

Menu bars are important parts of programs that let you control specific
aspects of it. Most programs use the *Classic menu bar*, Google Chrome
uses the *Chrome menu*, and most Microsoft programs use the *Ribbon*.
We’ll focus on other menu bars in later courses, but for now, we’ll work
with the Ribbon.

### The Ribbon {#the-ribbon}

The *Ribbon* is a type of menu bar that has an upper and lower portion.
The *upper ribbon* has general groups, like “Home,” “Share,” and “view.”
The *Lower Ribbon* has commands relevant to the upper ribbon. For
example, “email” is in the “Share” ribbon.

Your screen reader will call the upper ribbon controls “Tabs”. For
example, if you are focused on the Home item, it will say “Home tab”. To
enter the ribbon area, press **Alt**. You’ll be focused on the “File”
item, which is a menu that opens when you press **Enter** on it.

To navigate ribbon tabs, use the **Left** and **Right** arrow keys. To
open a tab, use the **Enter** key, then you can tab through the items
there. Using the ribbon, or any menu bar, is a good way to find out what
a program can do.

<aside markdown="1">

Note that the ribbon in File Explorer is different than the ribbons in
Office programs.

</aside>

You can also open the ribbon tabs directly, by listening for the
keyboard command to use. for example, you can press **Alt + H** to open
the Home tab. There are keyboard commands for most actions in the
ribbon. For example, press **Control + Z** for Undo, **Control + X** for
cut, **Control + C** for copy, and **Control + V** for Paste.

Activity {#activity}
--------

-   Open File Explorer.
-   Find the “Documents” folder.
-   When focused on a file, open the Home tab on the ribbon.
-   Find the “copy to clipboard” command.
-   Press **escape** a few times to exit the ribbon.
-   Copy a document from the “Documents” folder to the “downloads”
    folder using the keyboard commands given above.
-   In the downloads folder, press the **delete** key to delete the file
    just copied. If this doesn’t work, make sure you select the file
    with **space bar** or the arrow keys.
