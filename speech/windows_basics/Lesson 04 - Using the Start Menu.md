The Start Menu {#the-start-menu}
--------------

The *Start Menu* is the “launchpad” for all of your programs on the
computer. It allows you to run a program, or find items on your
computer. From the Start Menu, you can start a web browser, to navigate
the Internet, an email program, word processor, game, media player, or
administrative tool.

The Start Menu is slightly different depending on what version of
Windows you have.

Windows XP
:   The Start Menu opens, and is a menu which you navigate with up and
    down Arrow keys. It contains sub menus which you enter or close with
    the right or left arrow.

Windows Vista
:   Same as XP, with the addition of a “search box” at the top.

Windows 7
:   Same as Vista

Windows 8
:   Start Menu is called “Start Screen,” and is a grid of icons
    navigable with all four arrow keys

Windows 10
:   Similar to the Windows 7 Start menu, with a Search box at the top,
    with icons in a list, a list of pinned icons, and the ability to
    switch to Start Screen. Navigate this with the Up and down arrow
    keys. In Desktop mode, there is the normal start menu. On tablet
    mode, it is the Start sCreen.

Since Windows 10 is now ubiquitous, and all new and upgraded PC’s have
it, we’ll focus on Windows 10’s Start Menu.

### Navigating the Windows 10 Start Menu {#navigating-the-windows-10-start-menu}

When you press the **Windows** key to open the Windows Start Menu, you
are placed in a search box, where you type the name of the program or
folder that you want to open. A list of suggestions appear, and your
screen reader will read the suggestion in focus. To open that program or
folder, just press **Enter**. Now, the program or folder you have
selected will open. Your screen reader may say “Task Bar,” meaning that
you are back near the Desktop. After a few seconds, it will then read
the title of the program, then the focused item within that program.

If you open the Start Menu again, you’ll find that you’re back in that
search box. Try pressing the **Down Arrow** to go to the list of all
programs on your computer. The list will start with a *header* which, in
this case, is the letter of the beginning of the app’s name. This list
nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnis in alphabetical order, so headers will range from A to Z.

What happens if you press the **Tab** key? Try it. Don’t be afraid to
explore, as long as it is for educational purposes. Just don’t spend too
much time on exploring. You’ll find a “pinned apps” list, a button to
show or hide labels, the search box, and the “all apps” list again.

The Pinned Apps list is a list of apps that are “pinned” to that list.
This means that they will not change or be removed from that list. You
can pin apps to this list from the “all apps” section.

Some apps have “live tiles.” This means that the icon contains
information from the app that is updated over time. The weather app on
the Start Menu, for example, may show the current weather, or the news
app may show a current headline. Your screen reader will read these live
tiles when focus is placed on the app’s icon.
