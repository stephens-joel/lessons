Navigating Windows {#navigating-windows}
------------------

For people who have vision, navigating Windows is simple: find on the
screen what you want to activate, bring the mouse pointer to that
location, and click twice; one click for focusing on that item, the
second to activate that item. So, when you read a manual, article, or
lesson meant for sighted users, remember that “click” means to activate
an item, by pressing **Space Bar** or **Enter**. To activate an item,
though, you must find it first. So, if a lessons says “click on Lesson 2
Quiz” you must press **Tab** until you hear “lesson 2 Quiz,” and then
activate it with **Space bar** or **Enter**.

For keyboard users, screen reader users included, navigating is
slightly more challenging, because screen readers do not read the
entire screen, and do not walk one through tasks as Digital
Assistants, like Google Assistant, Siri, and Cortana do. Instead, the
screen reader simply reads what it is focused or “highlighted,” on,
and allows the user to decide what to do next. A user could press
**Tab** to navigate to the next item on the screen, or **Shift + Tab**
to navigate backward, **F6** to move to a different part of the
window, or press a “keyboard shortcut” to activate a function which is
not currently in focus, or even in view on the screen.

Navigating Windows will be difficult starting out, but as you practice,
it will make more sense to you, and you will be able to navigate the
interface easily and quickly. However, to get there, you will *have* to
practice often.

Screen readers also have their own navigation and information
commands, to support Windows navigation. Screen readers can have the
time read to the user, or report battery status, control the mouse
pointer, or provide a list of items on a web page. NVDA has Object
Navigation, JAWS has the JAWS cursor, and Narrator has Scan Mode. All
three of these are designed to navigate by a single item on the
screen, in the case of NVDA and Narrator, or navigate to things the
keyboard navigation cannot access, in the case of the JAWS cursor.

A blind Windows user may take advantage of these navigational aids,
although these are becoming less necessary as Windows accessibility
improves with software updates. A Narrator user, however, may find
that Scan Mode provides a good enough experience that it becomes the
main method of *basic* navigation for such a user.

There are keyboard commands for both Windows itself, and screen
readers. To know whether a keyboard command is a Windows or screen
reader command, study the keys used in the command. If the command has
the Alt Control or Windows keys in it, it is most likely a Windows
command. If it has the Insert key in it, however, it is most likely a
screen reader command. for example, **Control + S** is a Windows
command, but **Insert + Control + S** is a screen reader command. Most
screen readers give commands with the Insert key substituted by the
name of the screen reader. For example, **Insert + F** in JAWS is
**JAWS Key + F**, in NVDA it is **NVDA + F**, and in Narrator it is
**Narrator + F**. In courses from E. H. Gentry, it will just be called
Insert or, rarely, Modifier.

Along with **Tab** and **Shift + Tab** are the Arrow keys. These
navigate text areas, called *Edit Boxes* in Windows. These boxes
contain any text, and are used in some programs to provide status
messages or information. The arrow keys can also be used to navigate
content on the Internet, navigating by line, up and down, or
character, left and right, like in a document.

Keyboard Shortcuts are also great ways to navigate Windows. For example,
holding **Insert** pressing **Down Arrow**, then releasing both keys is
a keyboard command in almost all Windows screen readers. It begins
reading from the current line, to the end of the document or web page.
In many courses and websites, keyboard shortcuts (or key commands) are
written in a specific way. The keyboard shortcut **Insert + Down Arrow**
tells the user to hold down the Insert key, press Down Arrow and
release both keys. The notation **Control + S** tells the user to hold
down the Control key, press “S”, and release both keys. If the
user only has to press one key, though, some courses simply put the key
in quotes, like “Press the ‘h’ key to move to the next heading.”

### Activity {#activity}

Now that you know basic navigation, try the following activities for
practicing what you’ve learned.

-   Press the **Up Arrow** to navigate to the previous line, then press
    **Insert + Down Arrow** to continue reading.
-   Press **Shift + Tab** to navigate to the previous control, then
    press the “h” key until you hear “activity heading level 3” and
    press **Insert + Down Arrow** to continue reading.
-   Press **Insert + F12**. What does this keyboard shortcut do?
-   The next section will be a quiz. Tab to “lesson 2 quiz” and activate
    the Link with **space bar** or **Enter**. Use the Arrow keys to
    navigate this page, and **Space Bar** to interact with items if
    needed, for example, to type in an Edit Box, or Check a checkbox or
    radio button. If you enter an Edit Box, press **Escape** when done
    typing, to exit the area and return to navigating with the arrow
    keys. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next lesson. To
    move to the next lesson after completing the quiz, tab to “Lesson 3”
    and activate the link with **Space bar** or **Enter**.
