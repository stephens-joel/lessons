beginning {#beginning}
---------

Up to now, we’ve simply moved around windows. Now, let’s start creating
something. First, let’s open a program where we can write things.

Press the **Windows** key, to open the Start Menu. Type “Wordpad” and
press **Enter**. You’ll hear, among other things, “Word Pad, untitled,
edit, blank.”

We’ve just opened a blank document. Let’s write some text. You can write
anything, but if you want something to practice with, write the
paragraph below:

> Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
> display editor. This manual describes how to edit with Emacs and some
> of the ways to customize it; it corresponds to GNU Emacs version 26.3.

You should now have three lines of text. Try these keyboard commands
with them.

Left and Right arrow
:   Move by letter (character).

Up and Down arrow
:   Move by line.

Control + Left and Right Arrow
:   Move by Word.

Control + Up and Down Arrow
:   Move by paragraph.

Home
:   Move to beginning of line.

End
:   Move to end of line.

Control + Home
:   Move to beginning of document, or “top of file”.

Control + End
:   Move to bottom of document, or “End of File”.

Page Up
:   Move one screen full of content up.

Page down
:   Move one screen full of content down.

Try moving around the document. Notice what your screen reader says in
response to the movement. Be mindful of this as you edit text.

### The cursor {#the-cursor}

The cursor [^1] is how one navigates text fields. This includes text
editors: Emacs, Visual Studio Code, Notepad, and Word pad, word
processors: like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and LibreOffice, and
online forms: like username fields, and comment text entry areas.

1.  Moving the cursor

    In Windows, you can move the cursor by using the arrow keys, home,
    end, page up, page down, and a combination of these with the control
    key. This is what you did with the sample passage above. The cursor
    moves to the left of what the screen reader says.

    imagine that the cursor is to the left of what the screen reader
    says. It is like the erasing head of a Perkins Brailler. So, if you
    move the cursor one character to the left, the cursor moves from its
    current position, and deletes the character before the one spoken by
    the screen reader. In this way, actions are performed.

    In our test paragraph, position the cursor so your screen reader is
    at the end of the last line in the paragraph. Now, press
    **Backspace**. You’ll here the previous character be deleted. If you
    need help with this section, you may always ask your instructor for
    help. Now that we have the period deleted, backspace two more times.
    This gets rid of the 3, and another period. This leaves you with
    “Emacs 26” instead of “Emacs 26.3.”

select text {#select-text}
===========

To select text, use **Shift** with any cursor movement commands. For
example, use **Control + Shift + Right Arrow** to select the next word,
or **Control + Shift + End** to select from the cursor to the end of the
file.

Manipulating text {#manipulating-text}
-----------------

The following sections will teach you how to undo edits, move, copy, and
paste text.

### Undo {#undo}

If you ever make a mistake when typing, use the *Undo* function of the
program you are using. The usual hotkey is **Control + Z**. Try this
now.

### Cut {#cut}

To cut something is to move it from one place. Then, you can paste the
text somewhere else. To cut, first select the text to be cut, then press
**Control + X**.

### Copy {#copy}

To copy text, like copying a file, select the text, and press **Control
+ C**.

### Paste {#paste}

Pasting text lets you finish the cut or copy operation. To paste, press
**Control + V**.

The Clipboard {#the-clipboard}
-------------

The clipboard is a space in computer short-term memory that holds the
text you cut or copy. The text does not leave the clipboard once you’ve
copied text, so you can paste the text again, somewhere else. So, your
screen reader, when copying, cutting, or pasting text, may say “cut to
clipboard,” “copied to clipboard,” or “pasted from clipboard.”
