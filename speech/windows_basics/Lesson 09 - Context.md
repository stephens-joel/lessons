The Context menu {#the-context-menu}
----------------

All throughout Windows, and most other operating systems, there is a
menu that contains commonly used items. It is called quite a few things:
the “applications” menu, the “context” menu, or the “right click” menu.
Sighted people use the mouse and press the Right Mouse Button to access
this menu. Keyboard users have two ways of accessing this menu.

-   Press the Applications key on the keyboard, to the left of the right
    control key.
-   Press **Shift + F10**

Let’s open the context menu here in the lesson. First, read this entire
list, then try the steps.

1.  Determine how you can open the context menu.
    -   If you have an applications key to the left of the right control
        key, use that. It’s easier.
    -   If you need to, use **Shift + F10**. It’s more universal.
2.  at the end of this list, press the **control** key, then activate
    the context menu. You’ll find things like”Back” “Forward,” “reload,”
    and several other functions. In the future, you’ll learn keyboard
    commands for most of these, but even then, some commands do not have
    keyboard shortcuts.
3.  To exit the menu, press **Escape**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, let’s put that into use. Open the Context Menu, then choose
“Refresh,” and press **Enter**. The page will refresh. Find this section
(separator) again to continue. To do that, press S.

Activity {#activity}
--------

-   Open File Explorer, find a file, and open the context menu on that
    file.

-   Open the context menu on a desktop icon, then a taskbar item, then a
    start menu item.

-   Copy and paste a file using the Context mEnu. You can revisit old
    lessons to merge what you have learned in those lessons with the use
    of the Context Menu.

    Hint, simply replace use of the ribbon with the context menu.
