Introduction {#introduction}

The *Notification Area*, also called the System Tray or status area, is
a part of the Windows desktop which shows system notifications and
statuses. It is to the right of the start button and Task Bar, and to
the left of the clock.

Accessing the Notification Area {#accessing-the-notification-area}
-------------------------------

You can access the notification area using the Windows keyboard command
**Windows + B**. This will set focus to the notification area. Using
JAWS, you can alternatively use **Insert + F11** to access the
notification area in a vertical list.

Items in the notification area include:

-   A button to show all items
-   The network connectivity icon, used to connect to Wireless internet
    connections, if your computer has a Wi-Fi card.
-   Battery indicator, if your computer has an internal battery
-   Actions center, only on Windows 10, used to show app notifications.
-   Background programs, used to control functions of apps that run in
    the background, like Onedrive, Dropbox, and your screen reader if
    you have that function turned on.
-   Buttons to search with, or talk to, Cortana, Windows’ digital
    assistant.
