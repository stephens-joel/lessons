The Windows Desktop {#the-windows-desktop}

### About the Desktop {#about-the-desktop}

When you first start up your computer, your screen reader will say
“taskbar.” We’ll cover that later on, but for now, let’s start with a
widely used area of Windows: the desktop. The *desktop* is a grid of
items which covers the screen, used for selecting a program, file, or
folder to open.

You can store files, folders, and shortcuts to commonly used programs
here. However, because it covers the entire screen when the computer
first starts, it is advised that you keep the desktop clean and
uncluttered, so that any sighted people who may share your computer, or
help you learn to use it, may find desktop items easily. The more items
on the desktop, the smaller they are, and the harder it becomes for a
sighted person to single out an icon to click.

For a complete file storage and retrieval program, see [File
Explorer](Lesson 6, Using the Notification Area.md). For a clean way to find and open programs, see
[the start menu](Lesson 4, Using the Start Menu.md). For now, the desktop should have few
icons on it, including the Recycle Bin. The Recycle Bin will always be
there.

### Focus {#focus}

*Focus* is an important term for screen reader users. It is what the
screen reader has just read. Technically, it is the item which is in
keyboard focus, being what will be activated when **Space bar** or
**Enter** is pressed. You can hear what is in focus with **Insert +
Tab**. For example, if it says “taskbar,” it is focused on the Windows
Taskbar. It it says “Next button,” then it is focused on a button called
“Next.” Pressing **Tab** and **Shift + Tab** changes focus to the next
or previous item in the program that you’re in.

### Focusing on the desktop {#focusing-on-the-desktop}

To move focus to the desktop, we’ll use a Windows keyboard command.
**Windows + D** moves directly to the desktop, without making the window
you were in smaller. This means that the program you were in before,
like Google Chrome or Microsoft Word, is still on the screen, but the
screen reader has *focused* on the desktop. Alternatively, you can use
**Windows + M** to make all windows small, and the desktop large, if you
have some usable vision, in order to see the desktop better.

In either case, you’ll hear something like “Folder view list.” This
tells you that you’re in a folder view, like a list of files. The
desktop is a grid of items, visually in the form of clickable icons. A
*grid* is a file layout similar to a table. You must use all four arrow
keys to find all the icons on the desktop. The first icon you come to
may be the *Recycle Bin*, which holds all files you’ve deleted, waiting
to be deleted forever, or placed back into the folder where they were
deleted from.

When you arrow around the desktop icons, you’ll hear a few pieces of
information: the name of the icon, like “Firefox,” and the position of
the icon, like “2 of 10.” This helps you know where in the grid of icons
that you are. Please note that, even though your screen reader calls the
desktop a list, and most lists only require the up and down arrow keys
to traverse, the desktop is still a grid, requiring all four arrow keys
to traverse the grid.

When you find an icon you want to open, like the Recycle Bin, press
**Enter**. The program, file, or folder will open, and the desktop will
be placed in the background. To close an open program, press **Alt +
F4**.
