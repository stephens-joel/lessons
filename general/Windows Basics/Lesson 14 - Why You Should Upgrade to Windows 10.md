Lesson 14: Why You Should Upgrade to Windows 10

### Why you should upgrade to Windows 10

**Note**: The Windows 10 free upgrade offer expired on July 29, 2016. If you still want to upgrade to Windows 10, you'll need to purchase it from Microsoft [here](https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100).  

Windows 10 is the most recent version of the Windows operating system for PCs. Although it has mostly been well-received, Microsoft did attract some [controversy](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/microsofts-windows-10-push-is-effective-damaging-desirable-and-deceptive/) in 2016 due to its push to upgrade users from earlier versions of Windows. Many users complained that it was difficult to **opt out** of the upgrade, and in some cases their computers were upgraded without their knowledge. Despite this controversy, we do still recommend that you upgrade your computer to Windows 10.

#### Why should I upgrade?

If you're happy with your current version of Windows, you might be wondering **why you should upgrade**. After all, Windows updates have historically created a number of problems for PC users, especially with the release of Windows 8. While Windows 10 is not without some issues, it's probably the most **stable** and **secure** version of Windows that's ever been released. It also includes several [new features](http://www.gcflearnfree.org/windows10/windows-10-features/1/), including Microsoft Edge and Cortana, that can make your computer feel a lot more powerful.

Perhaps most importantly, Windows 10 will also continue to be supported by Microsoft for [much longer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/lifecycle) than Windows 7 or Windows 8. That's why we **strongly recommend** taking advantage of the free upgrade offer before it expires. As with any major operating system update, we also recommend [backing up your files](http://www.gcflearnfree.org/techsavvy/backing-up-your-files/1/) before upgrading.
