Lesson 10: Opening Files with Different Applications

### Opening files with different applications

When you open a file in Windows, it will usually open **in the default application for that type of file**. For example, a **photo** will open in **Windows Photo Viewer** (or the **Photos** application in Windows 8) by default. But you may not always want this. In this lesson, we'll show you how to **open a file in a different application**, as well as how to **change the default application** so a file will always open in your preferred program.

If you're using Windows 8, files will usually open in a **Start screen application**, even if you opened it from the **desktop**. If you prefer to work in the desktop, you can choose to open the file with a **desktop application**. For example, a **jpeg picture** in Windows 8 will open in the **Photos** application by default, but you can open it on the desktop in **Windows Photo Viewer** instead.

#### Opening a file in the default application

As you learned in our lesson on [Working with Files](http://www.gcflearnfree.org/windowsbasics/working-with-files/1/), you can locate and **double-click** a file to open it. It will open in the **default application** for that type of file.

#### To open a file in a different application:

Sometimes you may want to open a file in a different application **without changing the default**. For example, you may want to open a photo with **Microsoft** **Paint** to crop or resize it.

1.  From the desktop, **right-click** the desired file.

2.  From the drop-down menu, click **Open with**, then select the desired **application**. In this example, we'll select **Paint**.

3.  The file will open in the selected application.

#### To change the default application:

You may prefer to change the **default application** for certain types of files so they'll **always open in the new app** when you double-click them. For example, you may want your photos to always open in **Windows Photo Viewer** instead of the **Photos** application.

1.  From the desktop, **right-click** the desired file, select **Open with**, and click **Choose another app** from the menu that appears.

2.  Select the desired **application**. If you don't see the one you want, click **More apps** or **Look for an app in the Store** to look for other applications. In this example, we want to open the file in **Windows Photo Viewer**. Then check off **Always use this app to open .jpg files** and click **OK**.

3.  The file will open in the new application. The next time you double-click a file of that type, it will open in the new default application.
