Lesson 08: Keyboard Shortcuts in Windows

Using keyboard shortcuts is often **faster than using a mouse** because you can keep both hands on the keyboard. Keyboard shortcuts are also **universal**, which means you can use many of the same shortcuts in a **variety of applications**. For example, you can use the shortcuts to copy and paste text in a word processor and in a web browser.

### Using shortcuts

Many keyboard shortcuts require you to **press two or more keys in a specific order**. For example, to perform the shortcut **Ctrl+X**, you would press and hold the **Ctrl** key, then press the **X** key, then release.  

You'll use the **Ctrl (Control)** or **Alt** key to perform most keyboard shortcuts. You'll find these keys near the bottom-left corner of your keyboard.
