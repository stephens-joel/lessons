#### Common places to look for files

If you're having a difficult time finding a file, there's a good chance you can find it in one of the following places:

*   **Downloads**: By default, your computer will place downloaded files in a specific folder, known as the **Downloads** folder. If you're having trouble finding a file you downloaded from the Internet, such as a photo attached to an email message, this is the **first place** you should look. To view the Downloads folder, open **File** **Explorer**, then locate and select **Downloads** (below **Favorites** on the left side of the window). A list of your recently **downloaded files** will appear.

*   **Default folders**: If you don't specify a location when saving a file, Windows will place certain types of files into default folders. For example, if you're looking for a Microsoft Word document, you could try looking in the **Documents** folder. If you're looking for a photo, try looking in the **Pictures** folder. Most of these folders will be accessible on the left side of the File Explorer window.

*   **Recycle Bin**: If you deleted a file by mistake, it may still be in the Recycle Bin. You can double-click the Recycle Bin icon on the desktop to open it. If you find the file you need, click and drag it back to the desktop or to a different folder.

### Searching for files

Let's say you recently downloaded a few photos that were attached to an email message, but now you're not sure where these files are on your computer. If you're struggling to find a file, you can always **search** **for it**. Searching allows you to look for **any file** on your computer.

#### To search for a file (Windows 10):

In the **Search Box** next to the Start button, type to search for a file. The search results will appear above the search box.

#### To search for a file (Windows 8):

Click the **Start button** to go to the **Start screen**, then start typing to search for a file. The search results will appear on the right side of the screen. Simply click a file or folder to open it.

#### Tips for finding files

If you're still having trouble finding the file you need, here are some additional tips.

*   **Try different search terms**. If you're using the search option, try using different terms in your search. For example, if you're looking for a certain Microsoft Word document, try searching for a few different file names you might have used when saving the document.
*   **Open the last application used to edit the file**. If you know you used a certain application to edit a file, open that application and select **File** **> Open > Recent** from the menu. The file may appear in the list of recently edited files.
    
    ![Microsoft Word](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/55e0919c24929be027950a02_08_28_2014/findingfiles_word.jpg "Microsoft Word")
    
*   **Move and rename the file after finding it**. Once you've located the file, you may want to **move it to a related folder** so you can find it more easily in the future. For example, if the file is a picture, you might move it to your **Pictures** folder. You may also want to give it a file name that will be easy to remember.
