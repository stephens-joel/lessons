Lesson 06: Adjusting Your Settings

### Adjusting your settings

At some point, you may want to adjust your computer's **settings**. For example, you might want to change your **desktop background** or modify your **Internet** **settings**. You can change these settings and more from the **Control Panel**.

However, in Windows 10, the Control Panel has mostly been replaced by the **Settings app**. The Control Panel is still available, but most of the tasks and settings are now also located in the Settings app.

#### To open the Settings app (Windows 10):

Click the **Start** button, then select the **gear** icon.

#### To open the Control Panel (Windows 10):

Type **Control Panel** in the **Search Box** next to the Start button. Then, select the Control Panel app from the menu. Â

#### To open the Control Panel (Windows 8):

In Windows 8, you can open the Control Panel directly from the Start screen. Using your keyboard, type **Control Panel** and press the **Enter** key.

#### Adjusting application settings

You'll also be able to change the settings for different **applications** on your computer. You will usually find application settings under **File** **> Options**, **Tools** **> Options**, or within a separate **Settings** menu. Keep in mind that the location will vary, and some applications may not have any settings you can change.
